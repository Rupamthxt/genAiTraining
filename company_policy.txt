VectraDB Inc. - Employee Handbook & Company Policies
Last Updated: January 2026

1. Work Environment & Remote Work
VectraDB Inc. is a remote-first company. Employees are permitted to work from any location globally, provided they maintain a secure and stable internet connection. 
Core Collaboration Hours: Regardless of time zone, all employees are expected to be online and available for meetings between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). Outside of these core hours, your schedule is entirely flexible.

2. Paid Time Off (PTO) & Holidays
We believe in a healthy work-life balance. All full-time employees receive 25 days of paid flexible time off per year. Additionally, employees receive 10 paid sick days. 
Company-wide holidays include standard federal holidays, plus a mandatory "Winter Shutdown" from December 24th through January 1st where the entire office is closed.

3. Home Office & Equipment Stipend
To ensure our team has the best tools, every new hire receives a one-time $2,500 Home Office Setup Stipend. This can be used for desks, ergonomic chairs, monitors, or internet upgrades. 
Standard issue hardware is a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a high-performance Linux workstation. Hardware is eligible for a refresh every 3 years. If your equipment needs repair, contact IT support at it-help@vectradb.com.

4. Travel & Expense Policy
For authorized company travel, employees may book flights and hotels using the corporate portal. 
- Flights over 6 hours in duration are eligible for an upgrade to Premium Economy.
- Daily meal per diem during travel is capped at $85 per day.
- Alcohol is not a reimbursable expense unless part of an approved client dinner.
All expenses must be submitted within 30 days of the receipt date via the Expensify dashboard.

5. Data Security & AI Usage
Security is our top priority. Employees are encouraged to use Generative AI tools to enhance productivity; however, strictly no proprietary code, customer data, or internal architecture documents may be pasted into public LLMs (e.g., standard ChatGPT or Claude). 
For tasks requiring internal data context, employees must use our self-hosted, offline Llama 3 endpoints or seek explicit written approval from the Security Director.
